<h1>Foilen - Single Sign On</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Welcome on this single sign on system for all Foilen services.</p>
<p>With it, you can connect once and then access all Foilen services.</p>
<p>Currently, you can log in by setting a permanent password or by always requesting a single-use password that is sent to your email and valid for 15 minutes. With that last choice, you won't need to remember yet another password.</p>

<hr/>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>All we need is your email address and we will create a unique user id (to let you change email in the future). Your email will be used to send your single use password and some important notification about the services you are using.</p> 
<p>You will not receive promotions unless you explicitly request them.</p>

<p>To create an account, simply request a single-use password and if your email does not exists in the system, a new user id will be created on the fly.</p>
